<pre id="dd">Hi. My name is Homin. This is me in front of the wall painting.
The wings are so pretty, aren’t they? 
Many people like to take pictures in front of wall paintings.
They make old neighborhoods bright and new.
Last month, I visited a village with wall paintings in Yeosu.
As I was taking a picture, a light went on in my head. I thought, “I’m in the school art club.
Why don’t we do wall paintings like these?”
I suggested this idea at the next club meeting, and the members loved it.
We found a teen volunteer project on the Internet.
The project was to do a wall painting in our neighborhood.
We applied for it, and two weeks later, our club was selected!
The day of the project finally came. The project manager had us meet at the painting site at 9 a.m.
The wall was in very poor condition. There were strange writings and drawings on some parts.
Other parts had old posters on them.
We removed the posters first and painted over the writings and drawings with white paint.
The manager let us paint anything we wanted.
We decided to paint something cute because the wall was near an elementary school.
We divided into three groups and began painting.
I was in the group with Minsu and Jiwon.
I chose my spot and started to paint my favorite movie character.
Minsu painted some flowers and Jiwon did some background drawings.
Our club painted for about five hours.
After we finished, we got together and shared the day’s experiences.
Minsu was very proud of his flower painting.
He said, “My flower is so real that a bee landed on it.”
I said, “Drawing on a wall was much harder than drawing on paper.”
We all agreed that our wall painting wasn’t perfect.
But it didn’t matter. We made our neighborhood a little brighter and happier.
We were proud of ourselves. We didn’t just paint pictures on a wall that day.
It was a better tomorrow that we painted.</pre>
